Contributing
===============

We welcome all contributors to CVXPY. You don't need to be an expert in convex
optimization to help out!  To get started as a CVXPY developer, install CVXPY
from :doc:`source </install/index>`. Contributions to CVXPY are made through
pull requests or feature branches to our `Github repository
<https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy>`_.  For project ideas, consult our Github
`issues <https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy/issues>`_ page, which lists both
bugs and larger feature requests.
 
When navigating the source, keep in mind that CVXPY is a work in progress. The
only APIs guaranteed to be stable are those discussed in the API documentation.
All other APIs are subject to change without warning.  Files and symbols that
are certain to change in the future are marked "DEPRECATED" in the source.

Finally, feel free to introduce yourself on the `cvxpy
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cvxpy>`_ mailing list, which is for
users and developers alike. Use this mailing list to introduce yourself.  You
can also contact the project leads `Steven Diamond
<http://web.stanford.edu/~stevend2/>`_, `Akshay Agrawal <https://akshayagrawal.com>`_, and `Stephen Boyd
<http://stanford.edu/~boyd/>`_ directly.
